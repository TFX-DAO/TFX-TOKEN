Since the birth of blockchain technology represented by Bitcoin in 2008, the technology has achieved considerable development and more and more attention and recognition, especially in recent years, blockchain technology has become the focus of global attention. The researchers and developers of the blockchain industry have carried out all-round explorations from the realization of the underlying core technology to the application on the chain and then to the application in various scenarios. There is still a big gap between blockchain technology and large-scale practical application. In particular, the underlying core technology of blockchain has not yet made major breakthroughs. There are still many technical problems to be overcome. The foundation is unstable and it is difficult to exert practical effects. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out research and development on the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain, so as to provide reliable support for various blockchain applications, so as to promote the real application of blockchain technology in various fields and industries. , so that the disruptive technology of blockchain can serve human society faster and better.
